# Hivemind

Open source forum software to efficiently communicate the 
 ideas and the will of large populations (countries, cities, large  
companies, …) to the leading parties.


## Problem statement (country level)

Our current democratic system feels outdated:

- Limited and slow feedback cycles of the population, as elections are only 1 time every 4 years.
- No easy communication channel from the population towards the
leaders. Making it difficult to bring new ideas. Current communication
channels are labour and time-intensive such as protests, strikes or
media attention.
- People have to vote for parties that rarely fully align with their interests.
- Black-and-white thinking and a lack of nuance of the larger population due to low-quality media coverage.
- People stay in local communities, which lack variety in perspectives and reduce the openness of their minds.
- Corruption. People are easily corrupted when the discussion occurs behind closed doors.

## Proposed solution

Create a Reddit-like forum where people can propose ideas 
 in threads and discuss them with a lot of people from different  
backgrounds.

### Main features: (Core)

- Reddit-like threads with comments and up/down votes.
- Restricted login, so only people of a country can use it (Itsme for Belgium). The login module should be easily adjustable so other
organisations can host the forum with their login method.
- A voting option to vote yes/no on the idea of every thread.
- See the voting statistics per thread.

### Nice to have

- Auto summarising, to summarise the topic concisely on top of the thread.
- Auto reasoning and bias detection, to label reasoning fallacies and improve the discussion.

## What it is not.

Hivemind is not a replacement for the leading class, as it
  is not efficient to have everybody vote on every decision. See it 
more as a guiding tool for the people that make the decisions to 
align with the ideas and will of the population.


## Topics to be discussed:


### Project related

- What will be the user base? and is it ok to use the forum as a
guideline? e.g. what if only 10% of the population is actively using it.
- It is possible that this is a very bad idea, if so why?
- How to avoid echo chambers
- How to avoid fake news


### Technical things

- Start from scratch or fork existing repos that could serve as a starting point:
    - Forum magnum https://github.com/ForumMagnum/ForumMagnum
    - ...
- cloud or not?
- Federated or not? Nice for public service, but maybe more difficult security-wise and with the restricted login?


### Funding:

- Hosting a forum is expensive and it would be nice to pay contributors somehow.
